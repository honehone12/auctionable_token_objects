# tradable_token_objects
another implementation of marketplace for token objects written in move.  
unique idea of this implementation is that auction resouces are stored in object's address.  
this allow us start auction for token objects without central platform.  
things are going to be much simplified for p2p trading, in game trading etc.  
we don't need another smart contract for safe transfer and safe paying, as it is alrady in object's contract.
