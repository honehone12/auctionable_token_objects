# token_objects_marketplace2
another implementation of marketplace for token objects written in move.  
unique idea of this implementation is that auction resouces are stored in object's address.  
this allow us start auction without central platform or make things much simplified for p2p trading, in game trading etc.  
in short, we don't need another smart contract for auctions, as it is alrady in object's address.
